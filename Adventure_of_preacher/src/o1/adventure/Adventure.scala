You see someone running towards your car, *I hope it's not one those journalists trying to destroy my business
maybe I can get in the Cadillac Before she gets here*

Some reporter:
How are you sir, we would like to ask you, why you don't want to fly commercial.
You have previously said that it's like to
get in a looooong tube with a bunch of demons.

Preacher Kenneth:
*Ahhh... No time to think...*
Not the people. The main reason is that I'd have to stop all the time.

Reporter:
ok, but let's get back to the demons. You said yo don't want to get in a long tube with a bunch of demons.
Do you really think people who fly commercial are demons?

Preacher Kenneth:
NO I DO NOT AND DON'T EVER SAY I DID!!!

You point at the reporter and stare at her with a very angry face
and just when she is about say something, you remember the perfecr scripture.

Preacher Kenneth:
We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers

... And the interview continues....

Reporter:
The bible also says, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
What do you say to that?

Preacher Kenneth:
You didn't read the scripture: But he said, all things are possible with God.

At the end you bless the reporter and get in your car, but you have a single thought of doubt:
Am I reaally going to get to heaven??
